Q2 [20 points]
Find all successful coaches who have won at least one medal. List them in descending order by medal number, then by name alphabetically.

File: q2_successful_coaches

Details: A medal is credited to a coach if it shares the same country and discipline with the coach, regardless of the gender or event. Consider to use winner_code of one medal to decide its country.

Your output should look like this:
COACH_NAME|MEDAL_NUMBER
Your first row should look like this:

BRECKENRIDGE Grant|9
--------------------------------------

SELECT ch.name AS COACH_NAME,COUNT(*) AS MEDAL_NUMBER
FROM medals m
JOIN athletes a ON m.winner_code = a.code
JOIN coaches ch 
ON a.country_code = ch.country_code
AND m.discipline = ch.discipline
GROUP BY ch.name
ORDER BY MEDAL_NUMBER DESC, COACH_NAME ASC;

Q3 [20 points]
Find all athletes in Judo discipline, and also list the number of medals they have won. Sort output in descending order by medal number first, then by name alphabetically.

File: q3_Judo_athlete_medals

Details: The medals counted do not have to be from the Judo discipline, and also be sure to include any medals won as part of a team. If an athlete doesn't appear in the athletes table, please ignore him/her. Assume that if a team participates in a competition, all team members are competing.
ps: my answer is giving all athletes who won medal from Judo disciplines.
-------------------------------------------
SELECT a.name AS ATHLETE_NAME,
       COUNT(*) AS MEDAL_NUMBER
FROM athletes a
JOIN medals m ON a.code = m.winner_code
WHERE a.disciplines LIKE  '%Judo%'
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY MEDAL_NUMBER DESC, ATHLETE_NAME ASC;

-------------------------------------------
Q4
For all venues that have hosted Athletics discipline competitions, list all athletes who have competed at these venues, and sort them by the distance from their nationality country to the country they represented in descending order, then by name alphabetically.

File: q4_Athletics_venue_athletes

Details: The athletes can have any discipline and can compete as a team member or an individual in these venues. The distance between two countries is calculated as the sum square of the difference between their latitudes and longitudes. Only output athletes who have valid information. (i.e., the athletes appear in the athletes table and have non-null latitudes and longitudes for both countries.) Assume that if a team participates in a competition, all team members are competing.

Your output should look like this:
ATHLETE_NAME|REPRESENTED_COUNTRY_CODE|NATIONALITY_COUNTRY_CODE
Your first row should look like this:
GREEN Joseph|GUM|USA
--------------------------------------------
-Not 100% completed-----------------------
SELECT a.name AS AthleteName,
       a.country_code AS CountryCode,
       a.nationality_code AS NationalityCode
FROM athletes a
JOIN results r ON r.participant_code = a.code
JOIN venues v ON v.venue = r.venue
JOIN countries c ON a.country_code = c.code
JOIN countries c2 ON a.nationality_code = c2.code;
